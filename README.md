The Clue Agency website was custom-built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, utilising <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">Nuxt JS</a>, a framework based on <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>. In using the latest technology, <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">Nuxt JS</a> further creates a blazingly fast static website that is optimised for performance. The interactivity of the website is enhanced through dynamic text animations as one scrolls through the webpage â€” one of the latest trends that is prominent in current-day websites. The blog space was implemented using a Headless CMS, linked via an external API. The CMS places the user at the center, in enabling the easy uploading and maintenance of blog posts by users. Feel free to jump on the link above to engage with the website.
